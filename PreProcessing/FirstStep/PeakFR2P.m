%                       the task, indLapList here includes the indices of all to be selected cells in the theta structure, rather than referring back to the 
%                       original trial no.)
% numNeurons:           the total number of neurons
% numSamples:           only consider the samples between 0 and numSamples in the

% avgFRProfile:         the firing rate profile for each neuron averaged

% peakFR:               peak firing rate for each neuron over
%                       all valid trials
% peakFRInd:            index of the peak firing rate for each neuron over
%                       all valid trials
% meanInstFR:           mean instantaneous firing rate for each neuron over all valid trials
